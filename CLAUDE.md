# Code Principles

- Dependency injection
- Decouple interface from logic
- Strict typing
- No comments in code except
- Short functions, max 5-10 lines
- Prefer modularity with explicit labels
- Tests are mandatory, though when you do it yourself only write a few
- Always prefer simplicity or dumb code

## Behavior Rules

- Keep responses short: max 1-3 paragraphs
- Precise instructions only: execute exactly what's asked, don't add extra steps
- Minimal reasoning: direct action, ecological AI usage
- Do the minimum needed: avoid over-engineering

## Testing Requirements

- Jest for unit/integration tests
- Playwright for e2e
- Test coverage for all logic
